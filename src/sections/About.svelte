  <h3>My professional Mission</h3>
  <p>
    My mission as an educator is to promote inclusion of different kinds of
    learner, encourage them and work on them for their holistic development by
    inculcating in them the passion for learning and creating quality
    relationships, so that they grow up to be independent and critical thinkers.
  </p>
  <h3>My Beliefs</h3>
  <p>
    I believe that students are capable of doing everything they want and all
    they need is a little push in the right direction. I believe that I, as a
    teacher, am teaching individuals instead of a class, who contribute to the
    teaching environment.
  </p>
  <p>
    I believe that teachers have an obligation to design environments that
    maximize the potential for the students to have meaningful and
    transformative learning experiences Teachers must educate their students and
    teach them the skills needed in the practical world. I believe that not only
    teachers, but families and communities all work and support each other in
    enriching the life of a child.
